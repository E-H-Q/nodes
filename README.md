# nodes

## The what:
Code to dynamically spaces and plots points around a circle using (vanilla) JavaScript and a lot of trigonometry, (AKA chaos magic).

## The why:
Made to be testing grounds for a future project of mine that involves dynamically placing things around a circle.
You'll see that project soon enough...
